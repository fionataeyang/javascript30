This is about practicing JavaScript in 30 Days with https://wesbos.com/.

I have subscribed this tutorial on March 29th 2017. But I haven't watched the videos and didnâ€™t follow the daily to practice JavaScript when I was working as a senior UI/UX designer.

I Started to practice JavaScript to improve my code skil. I haven't found any new job, this is because it's hard to find a developer job for a junior or a senior UI/UX designer in Taiwan. Especially, Chinese New year is coming soon. And my age is also a limited in Taiwan.

Thus, this is a reason to make me wanted to practice and focus on JavaScript field if I wanna to find a developer job and work for.

I finsihed the first course and made my first commit with drum kit. It's very funny.
